## Cine <br>
· The program asks you the number of `columns` and `rows` of the cinema <br>
· Then it asks the info about the `movies`, and it creates one hall for each movie <br>
· The `sits` of each hall are created automatically <br>
· When the sits are created, the program asks info about the `spectators` (their money, their age, the movie they watch are `random`) <br>
· If they have the age and the money needed, the program assigns to the spectator a `sit` in the hall randomly <br>
· Finally, it will show a `graphical representation` of the hall (with the sits filled) and the info about the movie and the spectators that can watch the movie <br>
· Only using `Java`
